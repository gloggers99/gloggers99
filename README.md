## About me
I'm a 17-year-old programmer living in California. I enjoy working on lower-level (operating system stuff, backend stuff, etc.) projects in languages like C, C++, Rust & many more. I've been programming since 9-years-old and I hope to eventually put my skills to use for a big fancy company or maybe even start my own, who knows! Right now, I am employed by a fantastic Code Ninja's franchise where I share my knowledge with those younger than me.

## Things to check out
- [`cogito_api`](https://github.com/gloggers99/cogito_api)
	- The rust-based backend for [William Chastain](https://github.com/crazywillbear)'s philosophy research AI agent. It is a REST API written for pure speed and security using the `actix-web` framework. It uses the `Argon2id` password hashing algorithm and a containerized PostgreSQL database with much more fancy stuff implemented as well.
- [`obj`](https://github.com/gloggers99/obj)
	- Insanely fast `.obj` file importer written in C. This project is more of a show off of my C skills than anything very practical.
- [`GFX`](https://github.com/gloggers99/gfx)
	- An OpenGL rendering engine written in C++. This project implements `VertexStack`'s, a custom-written `.obj` and `.mtl` importer which is insanely fast (not as fast as the C one (`obj`) but has more features), and the magnum opus is the cross-platform multithreaded shader hot-reloading system! (What a mouthful.) This project is not my priority, but eventually I will return to it.
- [`cppml`](https://github.com/gloggers99/cppml)
	- A HTML DSL for C++. This project shows my C++ knowledge and shows the capabilities of metaprogramming and enabling a type-safe and structured manner to write HTML.
